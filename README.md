# 📊 Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This is Task 1 of my **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology**, where I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis** on a real-world dataset to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights using Python.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis
- Generate visual insights through histograms, boxplots, and bar charts
- Understand data distribution, correlation, and basic relationships

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of global demographic data containing variables like:
- Population
- Birth rate
- Death rate
- Life expectancy
- Literacy rate, and more

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Histogram** analysis revealed skewed distributions in population variables
- **Boxplots** identified outliers in birth and death rates
- **Bar charts** helped compare literacy across regions

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- Histogram of a continuous variable (e.g., population)
- Boxplot for detecting outliers
- Correlation heatmap for numeric features
- Pairplots to study relationships

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab
